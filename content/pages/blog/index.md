    content: "Fantasy:\_The power or process of creating especially unrealistic or improbable mental images in response to psychological need. Well what if I told you that now you can make your wildest fantasies become reality!\n\nHere at Fantasy you have the ability to do just that. We are a network that brings everyone together from all over the world where people can express themselves in any way, shape or form. If you wish to see a blond girl jump in a bathtub filled with chocolate than you can for the right price.\_\n\n## How does this work?\n\nOn our website and app (near future) we will be setting up pages where you may list ads totally for free where you maybe be offering an online service or may be looking for an online service. You will be able to negotiate the price of the service and when both parties have agreed then the contract between both parties will be made. You will be able to pay directly though our system at no cost using our Fantasy token. This is important to keep both parties protected and to guarantee of payment and service will be delivered. Both parties must have the minimum of the price of the service.\n\nFantasy tokens will be used to purchase services, running ads, making your profile more visible and buying merchandise.\n\nThere will be an NFT marketplace exclusive for Fantasy users.\n\nThe $FSY token has three functions that occur during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn.\n\nFANTASY brings the most revolutionary mechanism to the BSC ecosystem: Earn $BNB by holding $FSY token\n\n## Benefits of holding Fantasy\n\nAfter you purchase $FSY you will automatically receive $FSY tokens in your wallet (2% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders, 2% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders. The burn address is also a holder; thus each transaction helps deflate the supply.)\n\nEarn $BNB by holding $FSY\n\n4% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders in $BNB\n\nThe BNB reward solely depends on the transaction volume of Fantasy “FSY”\n\nJoin us on our journey. Because this WILL be a WILD one!\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n5.2% -liquidity pool\_\n\n5% - distributed to top creators\_ who use fantasy platform it will be based on perks\n\n0.8% - Team\_\n\n30%\_ - Presale\n\n8%\_ - Seed sale\n\n5% - Marketing\_\n\n1%\_ - Distributed to fantasy users\_\n\n45%\_ - Burn\n\n\n## Burn\n\nWe will burn 45% of FSY.\_\n\nHaving burns controlled by the team and promotion based on achievements helps keep the community rewarded and informed.\_\n\nThe conditions of the manual burn and the amounts can be advertised and tracked.\_\n\nFantasy aims to implement a burn strategy that is beneficial and rewarding for those engaged for the long term.\_\n\nFurthermore, the total number of $FSY burned will be featured on our readout located on the website, allowing for further transparency in identifying the current circulating supply at any given point in time\n\n## Give away\n\n5% - distributed to top creators who use fantasy platform it will be based on perks\n\n## Earn BNB\n\nYou can collect $BNB by accessing the dashboard page (will be listed here when live).\n\n4% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders in $BNB.\n\nYou will have to wait for a specific duration called cycle (about one week) to collect your BNB reward.\n\nIf you continue to add more than 2% (threshHoldTopUpRate) of your $FSY balance during this waiting duration, the waiting duration will proportionally add up with the cycle.\_\n\n(If you sell $FSY, it does not affect your cycle)\n\nFor example, on the first day of your cycle, you add up more than 5% $FSY, you have to wait: 5%\\*7days = 8,4 hours more. That means you can collect BNB after seven days and 8,4 hours.\n\nBut if the threshHoldTopUpRate >= 100%, the waiting duration will add up max to 7 days.\n\nFor example, on the first day of your cycle, you add up more than 100% $FSY, you have to wait: 7 days more. That means you can collect BNB after 14 days.\n\nIt will prevent cheaters who try to add more $FSY at the end of each cycle.\n\n## Collect BNB Tax\n\nIf you collect more than 2 BNB, 20% will be used to buy back $FSY at the market price and burned immediately. This feature helps to deflate the supply and increase the price value of $FSY for long-term $FSY holders.\n\n## Transactional Tax\n\nWith $FSY, each transaction (buy/sell or wallet transfer) has a 10% tax where:\n\n4% of every transaction contributes towards automatically generating further liquidity on Pancake Swap, benefiting long-term for $FSY holders.\n\n4% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders in $BNB.\n\n2% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $FSY holders. The burn address is also a holder. Thus, each transaction helps deflate the supply.\n\nIf a pool is staked, the Pool contract will be threaded as one of the holders, will receive the same as mentioned above. The Pool contract will receive the bonus manually.\n\n## Anti whale zone\n\nSo transactions (sell/buy and wallet transfer) that trade more than 0.05% of the total supply will be rejected. This will protect the price movement as well.\_\n\nFurthermore, whales who make a transfer (between 2 wallets) larger than 0,05% of the total supply will be charged 2 BNB. These 2 BNBs go straight to the BNB reward pool in\n\nThis feature prevents pump-dump-existing whales because they can destroy the project.\n\n## What is Zero Balance?\n\nWhen you sell all of your $FSY and your balance will be 0. Then you continue to buy $FSY again. Your next collectible date will be extended for 50 years.\n\nGood luck, your children can collect your BNB for you!\n\n## What should I do?\n\nIf you still want to collect your BNB, you can transfer your $FSY to another wallet.\n\nThen you can collect your BNB normally without waiting for over 50 years.\n\nRemember, 10% will be charged when you transfer between wallets.\n\nFurthermore, whales who make a transfer (between 2 wallets) larger than 0,05% of the total supply will be charged for 2 BNB. These 2 BNBs go straight to the BNB reward pool in\n\n## Automatic LP\n\nAs mentioned previously, as there is a 10% tax on each transaction, 4% gets added to the liquidity on PancakeSwap through the contract.\n\nThis liquidity becomes locked away and inaccessible, raising the price floor every time a transaction is made.\n\n## Road Map\n\n#### Phase 1\n\n*   Website and social media channels launch\n\n*   Marketing & partnership with influencers\n\n*   Private seed sale\n\n*   presale\n\n*   Pancakeswap launch\n\n*   Partnership rollout\n\n#### PHASE 2\n\n*   CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko & Blockfolio listing\n\n*   TechRate audit\n\n*   10.000 holders\n\n*   Onboarding our first model\n\n*   Website v2 Launch\n\n#### PHASE 3\n\n*   Release our own adult platform\n\n*   Disrupt the adult industry online\n\n*   Onboarding 20+ models\n\n*   Advanced marketing\n\n*   Fantasy Mobile App\n\n\n## Social Media&#xA;\n\nTelegram: <https://t.me/fantasycoinofficial>\n\nTwitter: [www.twitter.com/fantasycoin\\_](http://www.twitter.com/fantasycoin\\_)\n"
